# SEC440-Ransomware
This is just a proof-of-concept Ransomware written by Michael Verdi and Aaron Leach utilizng the Python interpreted language. Its fucntion is to demonstrate the cryptographic concepts involved in ransomware. It takes a file and first generates keys to be used for encryption, encrypts the targeted files, then adds a new file extension to the encrypted files, deletes the unencrypted files and once provided by the target, a key will be used to be able to decrypt the files to there original state.
